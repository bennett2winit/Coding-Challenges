# JSON Parser

This is a python script that takes an input from the command line and outputs whether the file is a valid JSON, and why not if it is invalid.

## jsParseV2.py

I was unhappy with the readability and maintainability of the original jsParse script. While it passed all of the tests, after 3 days, I am unsure of how it passed the tests.

In the second iteration I intend to implement more abstraction. I have never really understood Object Oriented Programming, but at first glance it appears to be the solution to the problems I am encountering.
